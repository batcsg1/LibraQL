# About the Project

## Database Storage:
### Bye Bye JSON...
There are many No-SQL DBMS's out there, in particular document DBMS's such as **MongoDB**, **CouchDB** and **RavenDB**. All of these DBMS's store data in a JSON-like format. Now if you're wondering what heck [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is all about, it is simply a very popular data format that is primarly used by web applications. It is short for (_*JavaScript Object Notation*_).

The problem with **JSON** however, is that is not a particularly token efficent format, in laymans term's meaning there are many redundant characters such as **brackets** `[]`, **braces** `{}`, **quotes**: `""` and **commas** `,`. This inflated amount o tokens can get very hard to read for tools like DBMS's to process, particularly when reading through large datasets.

### Hello TOON...
However **LibraQL** utilizes a new revolutionary data format called **TOON** _(Token-Oriented Object Notation)_ for its database storage. 

### Visuals of why TOON is better
**JSON** vs **TOON** objects containing 2 users:
**JSON**: _12 lines of code_
```json
"users": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "role": "admin"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "role": "user"
    }
]
```
**JSON**: **_only 3 lines of code!!_**

```toon
users: id,name,role
1,Alice,admin
2,Bob,user   
```
As you can see, TOON takes up way less lines compared to an equivalent JSON object with equivalent data. Anyways, enough about my rant about TOON, here is some more stuff about TOON linked down below:

## Data Access

The query language for **LibraQL**, is heavily inspired by the query language used in the popular No-SQL DBMS, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/query-documents/). Just like MongoDB's query language, LibraQL utilizies the creation of databases as objects, the creation of collections as well as using functions for **_creating, finding, modifying and deleting_** items in data collections.

### Basic data access functionalities in LibraQL vs SQL
| Function | LibraQL | SQL _(MariaDB_) |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Creating a database | `db = LibraQL("my_awesome_database.toon")` | `CREATE DATABASE my_awesome_database;`  |
| Creating a collection/table | `users = db.collection("users")` | `USE DATABASE my_awesome_database; CREATE TABLE users ( name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, age INT NOT NULL);`|
| Creating data | `users.insert({ "name": "Brent", "age": 21 })` | `INSERT INTO users VALUES ("Brent", 21); ` |
| Finding data | `users.find()` | `SELECT * FROM users;` |
| Updating data | `users.update({"name": "Brent"}, {"age": 34})` | `UPDATE users SET age = 34 WHERE name = 'Brent'; ` |
| Deleting data | `users.delete({"name" "Brent"})` | `DELETE FROM users WHERE name = "Brent";` |
